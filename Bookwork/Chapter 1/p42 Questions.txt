1.	A list in python is a collection of values that can be of any data type. It is used to store many values in the same variable.
2.	It avoids having to code the same instructions over and over again.
3.	newList = []
4.	Items
5.	emptyList = []
6.	list(string)
7.	myList.index(“p”)
8.	“in” and “not in”
9.	Declaring a variable to be used as a list.
10.	The list can be modified. You can change the value of an item of a list using its index, instead of having to declare a new list.
11.	myList.append(99)
12.	The first argument is the index of where the item will be inserted to, and the second argument is the value of the item to be inserted.
13.	
    list1 = [“this”, “is”, “a”, “list”]
    list2 = [“this”, “is”, “another”, “list”]
    newlist = list1 + list2
14.	
    list1 = [“test”, “list”]
    newList = list1 * 4
