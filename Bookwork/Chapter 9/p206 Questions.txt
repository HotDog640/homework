1. To make sure that programs meet their design requirements.
2. The smallest component of a program that can be tested.
3. automoated tests that test a unit.
4. software developers make unit tests for the computer to requirements
5. it's faster, and allows other devleopers to check your code.
6. An expected output for a given input.
7.

8. No, otherwise if there was a mistake, the same mistake would be present in the test.
9. Using a list of inputs and expected outputs, and running the function several times using a loop.
10. By importing the main program in the unit test script, and calling the function.
11. - It's fast
    - It allows for bugs to be identified easily
    - It provide sdocumentation
